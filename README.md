# Human-Resources

The project created for a practical training course in 2016 with other 2 students.
The website built using HTML5, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The website is to sends orders from the regular employee to the HR.

Additionally, the website has a: 
- Search contact page that contains the employee's picture, name and email. 
- The Admin can edit, delete and add employees. 
- The employee can send a direct message to another employee. 
- All orders from employees saved. 
- An employee can only request one order at a time, e.g. (if the employee ordered ink that request has to be either accepted or rejected to order extra paper).
